## Features provided by the file activity.txt
The file activity.txt si produced by run_analysis.R script.

Bellow the given number is the column number. It is followed by the column name wich is also the variable name.

"1" "subject": Id of the subject whose row belongs to.
"2" "activity": Activity : Can be LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS

Each variable is the mean of all source data rows that bellong to the couple (subject,activity) 
The variable name is the same name that exist in the source data.
In order to have information on their meaning and unit, you can read the information given by the file features.txt and features_info.txt that can be found in the zip https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
